## How to contribute

Anyone (the cleaner, a 12 years old child or a nobel rock science) could create a branch from master and create a PR.
This PR should have a description, and also unitTest. The solution must be reactive (callback hell, rxJava, verticles/actors, promises as completable futures, listeners... hooks) and documented.

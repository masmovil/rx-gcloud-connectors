# RxJava GCloud Connectors

The aim of this project is build the basics bricks in order to develop reactive applications over GCloud platform.

## Building blocks

* Firestore (current version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT)
* Datastore (WIP)
* Bigquery (WIP)
* CloudStorage (WIP)
* Pubsub (WIP)


## Who can contribute

Anyone (the cleaner, a 12 years old child or a nobel rock science) could push a branch from master and create a PR.
This PR should have a description, and also unitTest. The solution must be reactive (callback hell, rxJava, verticles/actors, promises as completable futures, listeners... hooks) and documented.
